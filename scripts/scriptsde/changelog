12/18/89
I should have started this a long time ago!
Added scripts 
<random_element (of given degree in a column space)
<random_map (of given degree between given modules)
<module_iso (a probabalistic check.) 

Changed 
<hom_and_map to produce a "pruned" answer; 
probably all the hom, ext, etc. scripts should do this,
since either to examine or to use further one wants
the pruned version.

Fixed cleanup section of double_dual_1

12/19/89
Rewrote adjoin_fractions so that it could
deal with fractions of negative degree (then it 
homogenizes, and dehomogenizes at the end).  Also
eliminated the reference to the ring in the calling 
sequence (it must now be the current ring) and 
modified the relevant places in "test of scripts"
and in "extend_ring".

12/30
Fixed <representatives, which was doing far too much work.
Discovered that a slightly different approach is faster
in all the cases I examined.  The improved version of 
the old representatives is in the script 
representatives_old (somewhere!)  The new version is
now called representatives.  There is no more representatives1

Changed 
<sat I J K [it]
(both the iterative and non-iterative versions)
to use a minimal set of generators for J mod I, 
computed with representatives. 
Had to add conditionals, since sat works even when
I is not an ideal!
On artificial examples
this tends not to help because J was chosen minimal
mod I, but representatives is fast, so it doesn't matter
much; and I think on real examples this will be 
a significant speedup.

12/31
Added
<rat_nor_curve p i [m] 
to compute the ideal (and defining matrix m) of a rational
normal curve through the coordinate points and p.
Future projects: do this for n+3 arbitrary points, 
by adding a coordinate transformation;
and do it (somehow!) for schemes in linearly general
position.
Added 
<column_vector
to make points (which are columns in <points) more
conveniently.
Added pack (not yet put into test_of_scripts)
To do: 
<unpack m i j mj
pack_betti m i
pack_reg m i reg

Note that the projective dim is just nrows i.

1/20/90
Added 
<perp m n 
to find the annihilator of a linear space of matrices
(for testing for 1-genericity (n meets the rank 1 locus?)
and 1/2-genericity (the projection of n intersect the
rank 1 locus onto one factor is finite?)

Fixed 
<random_map
so that the map from f:target a --> target b 
produced would be reduced mod im b -- in particular,
it is replaced by 0 if  im f is in im b.

1/21/90
Added 
<submat_by_degs
to find a submatrix having given row and col degs.
Why doesn't Macaulay create matrices with col degs ordered?

1/26/90
Added
<diff
to do what I wish the built-in diff did.

2/7/90  Oops!  Changed <diff to do what I really wish it did.

3/23/90 Got rid of some capitalized Ext's Hom's and Tor's;
Mike had told me the scripts did not work on Unix machines
with the caps.

3/28 Tested the scripts on Zariski.  Indeed, there were 
quite a number of troubles coming from capitalization.
Apparently when my machine uploads files, all the filenames
come out lower case.  For this reason I changed ALL names
to pure lower case.  Names affected:
K3_carpet -> k3_carpet
I_in_J -> i_in_j

Also, wedge_cokernel was sometimes referred to as wedge_coker.

Created a new test_of_scriptsDE.unix, same as old but
without the "reset" commands, which stop execution on
unix machines.  All working.

4/1/90
added 
<res m mm [length] [verbose]
to do what res_to_reg probably should have done.
With verbose set we still get the regularity bound printed
out, so we can get at it if necessary.

Added 
<remove_low_dim_id
following Craig's suggestion; got substantial speedup.  
Could we somehow use this with the radical scripts, rather
than removing components from the top (lowest dim) down???
Also, how does one use this idea in the case of a module?

5/1/90
Added 
<unmixed_radical2
following Vasconcelos' method. Given a good regular sequence,
it runs faster than our method.  Given a random regular
sequence it's a disaster (like projections.)

5/13/90
Added 
<sort_by_degree m n [cchange]
which reorders the columns of a matrix so their degrees are in
ascending order.  Shouldn't Macaulay give every matrix it
produces in this form, except where there is some reason not to, 
as for Koszul?

5/15/90
Added 
<regular_sequence i j
<regular_sequence1 i j
to find a maximal regular sequence in an ideal i. The method is
just the obvious, and is slow!  What's the right way to do this?

5/18/90
Corrected the algorithm for the linear case in 
<push_forward1
which gave bad results in case the current ring had fewer
variables than the source ring.  There is a bug in elim which
causes trouble over rings which are quotient rings mod a linear
form; this causes trouble in that case with 
subring and probably with other scripts as well!

7/31/90
Added 
<map_from_col
which is a different "adjoint"
to be able to compute arbitrary maps between modules,
after using <hom_and_map.
Code was a subset of that in "random_map", 
except for the part setting the degrees which was unneccessary
in the random_map context

	There is a potential bug in "map_from_col", in that columns
	of zeros may be given the wrong degrees.
	  
Fixed comments in "hom_and_map" to explain usage with
map_from_col.

11/10/90
Added degree bounds to pushforward1, subring, and
orbit_equations.
	This adds a potential problem:  If maxdegree is present, 
autodegree is reset 
	There should be a way to save it!
	Some time we should add a maxdegree option to pushforward.
	
11/10/90
Fixed several further problems with the linear case of 
pushforward1.  Now distinguishes an "easy case" where no
variables are lost -- then we just need a change of variable --
and a "main case", where there is a linear projection.  The
degree bound is operative only in the main case and of course in
the old nonlinear case.  A little weird?

12/9/90
Added 
<stack newmat mat1 .. matn
which "concatenates rows" of mat1..matn into newmat.  The degrees
are set so that the col degrees all match those of mat1.  This 
seems rather a poor convention, but it's not obvious what would be
better. 

Added 
<rat_nor_osc_locus u r I
1<=u<=r-2
which computes the ideal of the union of the osculating u-planes to
to the rational normal curve of degree r.  One problem is that in 
the elimination fairly high degrees are necessary (one set of 
variables has degree r+1).  This necessitates using several blocks
of variables, which makes the degree to which one must compute (and
the space required) rather more.  Still reasonable.  Because of
this, we abandonned our original plan of doing the elimination
directly, for maximal efficiency, in favor of the simplicity of
using "subring".

12/15/90
Fixed a bug pointed out by Mat Miller in 
<generic_mat
which was adding an extra column of zeros IFF an inequality was
satisfied between the number of rows and cols requested.

1/4/91
Got Mike S to provide a revision of "koszul" which sets degrees
correctly -- IN THE CASE OF A MAP TO THE RING.  Made the appropriate
changes to wedge_coker to make it functional.  Fixed a tiny bug
in binomial (which was causing error messages, no errors.)

4/9/91
Added "annihilates" to check whether a given ideal annihilates
a given module.  This is MUCH faster than computing the annihilator.

4/9/91
Changed "stack" to set the column degrees of the resulting
matrix from the row degrees.  This will eliminate most of the
uses of setdegs after it which were previously necessary.  

4/12/91
Fixed a bug in getvars which led to trouble in qrings where
one of the variables had become zero.  This caused trouble in 
pushforward1.
Note:  the "elim, keep" construction is bad! better to use a 
fetch and reset degrees (fetch is currently buggy, and resets
the degrees incorrectly when one of the columns is 0.)

4/12/91
Added a new version of annihilator, much better in many large 
examples.  Called simply annihilator.  
Note that this may make "unmixed_radical1" more competetive.
Need to check some time.

Changed copyring to put the component first in the new ring.

12/17/91 Added MacaulayRep

April 3, 1992
Added special_mat, shout_list
THERE IS A BUG IN wedge_coker.  The degrees are still set wrong.
An example is given at the end of the file.  I haven't fixed it
yet.

April 5, 1992
Changed special_mat to do something else.
Added sym to find the symmetric powers of a matrix.

July 4, 1992
Added select, sorts columns of a matrix according to a "key matrix".
Added sagbi and the script it calls, sagbi_step, to compute sagbi
bases.
Added lex_seg_ideal to produce lex seg ideals efficiently.
(change it to take a hilbert function as an input?)

November 5, 1992
Fixed a bug in regularity, that caused "array ref out of bound"
messages in various places, for example ext(-,r) (and wrong answers,
occasionally).

July 10, 1993
Added quotient1.

August 21, 1993
Added "projective_plane"

December 9, 1993
Replaced "col-deg" which now gets an "ambiguous command" error
by "col_degree" in half a dozen scripts from scriptsDE.

December 1993
Fixed  up "projective plane"
